"Rails generators":http://guides.rubyonrails.org/generators.html helps accelerate your development time, by quickly generating redondant code between web app. The layout is a good example of stuff you do for every project, starting from scratch each time is boring and not productive.
That's why I put my layout (application.rb, css, images) in a generator.
  
h3. What it looks like

It's a web application template obviously inspired by applications like "Basecamp":http://basecamphq.com/ or "Lighthouse":http://lighthouseapp.com/, the code is as clean as possible and minimalist.

h3. Installation

This generator is packaged as a "ruby gem":https://rubygems.org/gems/custom_layout, add it to your Gemfile.

{% highlight ruby %}
gem "custom_layout", :group => :development
{% endhighlight %}

Then you can run the generator.

{% highlight ruby %}
rails g custom_layout
{% endhighlight %}
