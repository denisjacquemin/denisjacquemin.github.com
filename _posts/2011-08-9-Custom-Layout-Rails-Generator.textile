Rails generators helps accelerate your development time, by quickly generating redondant code between web app. The layout is a good example of stuff you do for every project, starting from scratch each time is boring and not productive.
That's why I put my layout (application.rb, css, images) in a generator.
  
h3. What it looks like

It's obviously inpired by applications like "Basecamp":http://basecamphq.com/ or "Lighthouse":http://lighthouseapp.com/, the code is as clean as possible and minimalist.
